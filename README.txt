Advising Assistant
Advising Assistant is a command-line application designed to assist academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU. The application allows advisors to efficiently manage course information, helping them better guide students in their academic journey.
Objectives
The objectives of this project were to demonstrate mastery in:
* Developing code using algorithms and data structures to solve basic programming problems
* Reading and processing input data from a file
* Creating an interactive menu for user interaction
* Implementing sorting and searching algorithms
* Applying industry-standard best practices in code design
Features
* Load course data from a text file into a data structure
* Print a sorted course list in alphanumeric order
* Print individual course information, including prerequisites
* Handle user input errors with appropriate error messages
Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. The program will display a menu with the following options:
* Load Data Structure
* Print Course List
* Print Course
* Exit
* Select the option to load course data from a text file into the data structure.
* Select the option to print a sorted list of all the courses in the Computer Science department.
* Select the option to print the course title and prerequisites for an individual course.
* Select the option to exit the program.
When I developed the Advising Assistant, my goal was to create a helpful tool for academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU. I had a great time working with algorithms and data structures to make sure the program could efficiently process input data, sort courses, and display the necessary information. I also tried to follow the best coding practices to keep the code clean and easy to understand.
